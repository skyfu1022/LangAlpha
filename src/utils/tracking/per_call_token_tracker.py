"""
Per-call token usage tracker for accurate tiered pricing.

This module provides a custom callback handler that tracks token usage with per-call
granularity, enabling accurate cost calculation for models with tiered pricing,
2D matrix pricing, or input-dependent pricing.

Unlike LangChain's default UsageMetadataCallbackHandler which aggregates tokens
immediately, this tracker preserves per-call records before aggregation, allowing
accurate pricing where rates vary based on token counts.

    Tracks LLM token usage with per-call granularity for accurate tiered pricing.

    This callback handler captures token usage from each individual LLM call before
    aggregation, enabling accurate cost calculation for models with:
    - Tiered pricing (different rates based on token count thresholds)
    - 2D matrix pricing (rates vary by both input and output token counts)
    - Input-dependent output pricing (output rate based on input tier)

    The tracker maintains both:
    1. per_call_records: List of individual call records for accurate pricing
    2. usage_metadata: Aggregated usage by model for backward compatibility

    Example:
        >>> tracker = PerCallTokenTracker()
        >>> # Use in LangGraph workflow
        >>> result = workflow.invoke(input, config={"callbacks": [tracker]})
