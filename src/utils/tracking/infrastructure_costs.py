"""
Infrastructure cost calculation and credit conversion utilities.

This module provides functions to:
1. Track infrastructure usage (external paid services)
2. Calculate infrastructure costs based on usage
3. Convert costs to credits for unified billing

Pricing is loaded from providers.json at module initialization (single source of truth).
Currently tracks external paid search services defined in manifest:
- TavilySearchTool
- TavilySearchImages
- BochaSearchTool

Free tools (DuckDuckGo, Arxiv) and internal operations (cache, storage, filesystem)
are not charged and will result in 0 credits.

Usage:
    tool_usage = {"TavilySearchTool": 5}
    result = calculate_infrastructure_credits(tool_usage)
    # Returns: {"total_credits": 80.0, "services": {...}}
